# Infinite loops and Code Blocks
Another easy mistake that can happen when using loops is introducing an infinite loop. An infinite loop means the code block in the loop will continue to execute and never stop. This can happen when the condition being evaluated in a while loop doesn't change. Pay close attention to your variables and what possible values they can take. Think about unexpected values, like zero.

In the Coursera code blocks, you may see an error message that reads "Evaluation took more than 5 seconds to complete." This means that the code encountered an infinite loop, and it timed out after 5 seconds. You should take a closer look at the code and variables to spot where the infinite loop is.
