# GCP networking and load balancing

## Why does knowing GCP infrastructure matter?

Imagine that your team develops a recommendations engine that suggests products to customers based on their browsing history. You need a way to **scale**, **secure**, and **optimize** your application. This is where Google Cloud Platform (GCP) comes in. 

In this reading, you will explore GCP's networking infrastructure, including virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and load balancing. You’ll also learn how these technologies help improve the availability and responsiveness of your recommendation application. 

GCP is a high-quality, high-speed, and highly reliable global network that facilitates communication between various resources such as virtual machines (VMs), Kubernetes clusters, and managed databases, regardless of their geographical location. 

Google network infrastructure consists of three main types of networks:

* **A data center network**, which connects all the machines in the network together.
* **A software-based private wide area network (WAN)** that connects all data centers together. The software-based private WAN  is particularly beneficial for distributed applications that require fast and secure data transfer between different parts of the system, regardless of where they are located.
* **A software defined public WAN** that is designed for user-facing traffic entering the Google network. This network infrastructure is optimized for high performance and low latency, ensuring that users can access your applications quickly and smoothly, no matter where they are in the world.

## Pods, clusters, and GCP

Let’s imagine that you want to deploy your recommendation engine using a Kubernetes cluster on GCP. To secure and partition your cluster from the public internet, you must first create a VPC network. 

A VPC is a global, private network—partitioned from the broader GCP network—that facilitates communication between the Pods in your cluster, allowing them to interact with each other as if they were on the same local network, even though they might be running on different machines. This is crucial for distributed applications where different components (running in different Pods) need to communicate with each other.

The VPC not only provides an isolated network for the Kubernetes cluster, but it also enables secure communication with other GCP resources. For instance, your Pods might need to interact with a database or a storage service hosted elsewhere on GCP. The VPC ensures that these interactions can occur securely and efficiently over the private network, without exposing the traffic to the public internet.

## Key components of a GCP VPC network

Each VPC is divided into subnets, which are regional resources. Each subnet has a specific IP range, and you can have multiple subnets in a single VPC. When you create a Kubernetes cluster in a GCP VPC, you assign each node in the cluster an IP address from the subnet's IP range.

GCP also allows you to define firewall rules at the VPC level. These rules control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources. For example, you might have a rule that allows incoming HTTP traffic to your web servers, or a rule that blocks all outbound traffic to a specific IP range.

A GCP VPC network has several key components:

* **IP ranges:** Each VPC network and its subnets have associated IP ranges. These ranges are used to assign IP addresses to resources within the network and subnets.
* **Routes:** Routes determine the path that network traffic takes to reach an instance. By default, a VPC network has an implied route to the internet default gateway, allowing instances with external IP addresses to reach the internet.
* **Peering:** VPC network peering allows you to connect two VPC networks, potentially across different projects, as if they were one. This is useful for sharing resources across projects or organizations.
* **Firewall rules:** As mentioned earlier, firewall rules control the traffic to and from instances in your VPC network. They are a crucial part of securing your GCP environment.

You can find a complete list of the VPC components on the ~[Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/#all-features)~.

## Other network services

GCP offers several other networking services that are very useful for Python developers using Kubernetes. These include:

* **Cloud Domain Name System (DNS)**: Google Cloud DNS is a scalable, reliable, and managed authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) service that provides high DNS query speeds and low latency for your applications. If your Kubernetes application needs to map domain names to IP addresses (for example, if it's a web application that needs to be accessible via a custom domain), Cloud DNS can be a useful service.
* **Cloud Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Cloud NAT allows instances without a public IP address (like your Kubernetes Pods) to access the internet, while not allowing inbound connections from the internet. This can be useful if your application needs to reach external APIs or services but you don't want to expose your application to incoming internet connections.
* **Cloud Load Balancing**: Google Cloud Load Balancing allows you to distribute traffic across your application instances, which can be located in multiple regions. This can help increase the availability and reduce the latency of your application.

These are just some of the services available to help you. Each of these services can be managed and configured using the Google Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the Google Cloud Client Libraries (including the Python library). 

## A closer look: Load balancing

Imagine you’ve successfully set up your recommendation engine and it’s now running on its own VPC on GCP. During a regular workday, the recommendation engine performs well and handles the site's traffic without any issues. However, during your company's annual summer sale, the site experiences a surge in traffic. The recommendation engine struggles to keep up with the increased load, leading to slower response times and, in some cases, timeouts. You realize that they need a solution to handle these traffic spikes more gracefully. What to do? 

This is where Cloud Load Balancing comes into play. GCP provides several load balancing solutions that distribute incoming traffic among multiple instances of your application, helping to ensure that no single instance bears too much load. This can improve the responsiveness and availability of your application, especially during times of high traffic. 

Here are a few ways GCP helps with load balancing:

* **Global and regional load balancing**: GCP offers both global and regional load balancing. Global load balancing automatically directs user traffic to the nearest instance of your application, improving latency. Regional load balancing distributes traffic within a specific region.
* **HTTP(S), TCP, and UDP load balancing**: GCP supports load balancing for HTTP(S), TCP, and UDP traffic, allowing you to choose the right option based on your application's needs.
* **Managed Instance Groups**: GCP's managed instance groups work hand-in-hand with its load balancers. They maintain a pool of instances that can automatically scale up or down based on demand, and the load balancer distributes traffic across these instances.
* **Integration with Kubernetes**: GCP's load balancers can be easily integrated with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), allowing you to distribute traffic across the Pods in your Kubernetes cluster.

In your case, you do some research and set up a load balancer configured to distribute traffic across the Pods in the Kubernetes cluster. You also configure a managed instance group to automatically scale the number of Pods based on the incoming traffic.

The next day, as the summer sale continues, the recommendation engine performs significantly better. The load balancer efficiently distributes the incoming traffic across multiple Pods, ensuring no single Pod is overwhelmed. Meanwhile, the managed instance group automatically scales up the number of Pods during peak traffic times and scales them back down when the traffic subsides.

This is just one example of how GCP can help provide a consistent and responsive experience for the users of a Python application. How might it help you?

## Key takeaways

* A VPC provides the network infrastructure that allows for secure, efficient communication between Pods within the cluster and between the cluster and other GCP resources.
* Leverage GCP's load balancing solutions to provide a consistent and responsive user experience, especially during periods of high traffic.
